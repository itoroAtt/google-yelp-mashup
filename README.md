Itoro Akpan-Iquot's Google/Yelp Restaurant Mashup for P5
===============================

Instructions for running the program:

1) Load index.html.  Initial map, with a center of City of Atlanta, will display. In the left column is a listing of of restaurants.

2) To view listings and to filter results, click the, "toggle restaurant filter" button at top of page

3) Site uses offline.js to determine when application is offline.  For this to work, either:
a) View site at http://www.acewebdevelopment.net/neighborhood/index-2.html, or
b) Upload to your test server. If using this option, to avoid cross-domain issue, change line 88 to reference a file on your own server

4) Click markers to get info window of yelp reviews.  Click any returned item in left column to pull up same info window

5) To filter results, type the name of a restaurant based on returned results, click "search".  Map will display with markers of any matched restaurants

6) For this project, I used what I learned via the course videos, udacity's discussion forum and stackoverflow.com
